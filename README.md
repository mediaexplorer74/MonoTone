# MonoTone 1.0-prealpha - uwp branch 
![Logo](Images/logo.png)

"UWP-Remake" of ITCH.io MonoTone "game template" project.

## About
"What do you do when you can't afford internet or any kind of games? You'll have to entertain yourself with the click-and-drag box on your desktop. That's low budget entertainment at its finest!
Almost 5 seconds of intense gameplay!

Made for the MonoGameJam in a single day because time management is hard.
I still wanted to share it because I think the idea is funny and it's my first "game" made with MonoGame."
